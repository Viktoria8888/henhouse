## Game Rules

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where the objective is to get three of your marks (either 'X' or 'O') in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game can end in one of the following ways:

1. **Win:** If a player successfully places three of their marks in a row, they win the game.

2. **Draw:** If all cells on the board are filled, and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## How to Play

1. Choose a player to start as 'X' and the other as 'O'.

2. Click on any empty cell on the board to place your mark.

3. Take turns with your opponent, placing one mark at a time.

4. The first player to get three marks in a row wins. If the board is full and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Chat Feature

The game includes a chat feature that allows you to communicate with your opponent. Use it to discuss game strategy or simply chat while playing. Messages from a server will also appear there.
